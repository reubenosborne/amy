	<p>I probably shouldn’t have started my last evening in Bali washing spoons of kratom down with large bintangs but much can be excused when it’s your last night in ‘paradise’. Of course I’m not so proud of myself upon waking and it takes me a few snoozes of the alarm before I pull myself out of bed to pack.</p>

<p>My taxi driver decides to cancel on me last minute because when the universe gets bored its favorite game is to see how many people it can make miss their flight. I remedy this with a shower and a bowl of fruit because it turns out I also like this game. I even decide to honor the #minimalisttravellifestyle and leave all my Malaysian ringgit behind.</p>

<p>A blessing had befallen me the day prior when I found an SD card full of photos from my recent trip to America. I had assumed all of the photos were on my missing card so uncovering these precious memories makes me dizzy with appreciation and I spend the taxi ride to the airport editing until I’m forced to lay my head down and sleep.</p>

<p>The flight is unremarkable. I doze in and out of consciousness, dreaming of roti chenai and teh tarik as my German co-passenger sneezes next to, and on me.</p>

<p>Three hours of flying, two fingerprints scanned, two cheesy pretzels and one conversation with a non-english speaker later and I’m on the train to KL Sentral. This is the first glimpse of what life might be like for people here. Swathes of jungle hide buildings that look all but taken by the elements. Crumbling facades and stained walls house missing windows. The only sign of life is the laundry strung outside and rusty scooters in the front yard.</p>

<p>Once in KL Sentral I push through crowds of people, camera in hand, not afraid to look like a tourist because everyone is forgotten here. I’m taken by the contrast of old and new; this is the future depicted in films such as Blade Runner. Hustling, bustling, no time to stand still; stop in an alleyway to take a picture and you <em>will</em> piss someone off. Incense pours out of chinese stores, cured meats hang in glass cabinets, master roti makers pat and push greasy delicious breads with expertise, modern street art finds its canvas on concrete walls eroded by weather and time.</p>

<p>Located in a hundred year old Chinese heritage building <em>Mingle Hostel</em> is my home for the next few nights, though it may be a little more expensive than other hostels, it suits my needs well. Bang in the middle of Chinatown, surrounded by delicious food and photo opportunities, a train station down the road that can take you further afield - this is the place for me.</p>

<p>I check in and make my way to the rooftop bar. I have two focuses while I am here; meet people, eat food. I figure here is the best place to begin this quest. I find an animated bartender, Loson, in conversation with a friendly Russian girl, Katrin, and am asked if I want to join. Although travel has done a good job of eroding my shyness sometimes it will find it’s way in and so I’m exceptionally grateful for the people who happily wave you into the chair next to them.</p>

<p>Katrin has been living in Vietnam for two years working as a bartender in Nha Trang so I take the opportunity to ask about life in another country. I’m particularly interested in how one builds community and finds friends when living in Asia and she shares that although the former is easily found the latter has it’s difficulties. Vietnam is not Bali but I relate; I’ve found it difficult finding friends within the somewhat limited pool of (often alcoholic) expats and people passing through.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/mingle.jpeg" alt="Mingle Hostel" /></p>

<p>Katrin and I find some dinner at a middle eastern restaurant that caters to tourists who haven’t quite figured out the currency yet. Regardless, I chow into dolmades and tabouleh and felafel having not eaten anything remotely similar in months. Our conversation and thirst eventually leads us to a bar called PS150 on Pentaling st.</p>

<p>PS150 is housed in a pre-war shop hidden behind a tiny Chinese stationery booth. Once let in you walk past small, drape covered  that I later discover are nicknamed “tinder booths”. Past an outdoor terrace we find a strikingly sexy bar drenched in a red light from some neon Chinese characters. I am faced with a wall of various liquors and immediately know I will not be ordering a beer. The clientele make me feel under-dressed but I take a seat hoping nobody will notice my flip-flops and torn shorts.</p>

<p>The bartender calls me a “bartenders dream” when I ask him to collaborate on a drink with me. We devise a mezcal old fashioned with the tiniest splash of zest-adding lemoncello. He works calmly and meticulously and I feel myself honing my own cocktail skills just by observing. The finished cocktail is strained over a large square of ice and garnished with a thin slice of dehydrated lime. It is <em>divine.</em></p>

<p>I make conversation with a Malaysian girl sitting next to me who tells me she <em>adores</em> Bali. She’s at the tail end of an annual four month holiday and when she starts next she’ll be “Eat, Pray, Loving” her way through Bali, India and.. New Zealand. I ask her what she does to afford such a lifestyle and she tells me about the two startups she has created. It’s a reminder of how slow and small my life can appear; how achievements can be so subjective.</p>

<p>We enlist two of the bartenders to take us to our next stop, ShuangXi, a place shrouded in even more secrecy than the first. Having gained notoriety on Instagram it is a large warehouse apartment that is opened as a bar in the evening. One must ring ahead to reserve a place and then wait in a stairwell for the owner to collect you.</p>

<p>I struggle to think I’d be able to conjure a place as well put together as this one; it speaks to me on levels I forgot I desired. Beautiful local women swill wine in large glasses, talking in circles whilst throwing quick glances at us newcomers. Tattooed men laugh with fire in their eyes and cigarettes in their hands. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-M3-Y7_I54">Biig Piig</a> is projected on the wall across from me, serenading the space with her beautiful song. I am transfixed. The place is full of asian antiques, movie memorabilia, cabinets of curiosities. The blanks are filled with plants. The place has an authenticity about it and for the first time in a long time I don’t feel like I’m being “sold cool”. A corner is taken up by a large cage that houses three suspicious cats, I later find out there names are all variants of “Uncle” when “Third Uncle” swats at me through the cages bars. The bathroom is awash with a sickly blue glow.</p>

<p>We order a beer from the owner and I comment on his heavy black tattoo work. I’m comforted by heavy modifications in a way that few understand. Inquiring about who’s responsible for the impressive work that runs down his neck he responds: “some frenchie”. “The same frenchie that did my feet?” I ask as I show him my work by Guy Le Tatooer. We immediately find ourselves in a four hour conversation about the place he runs, Malaysian tattoo culture and split tongues. He has a cabinet that houses a collection of ear weights like I’ve never seen before but can very much appreciate and we share our passions for gold teeth, proper piercing techniques and modification steeped in tradition.</p>

<p>I meet his friends, some of which are tattoo artists themselves operating from the very space we’re in. We sit and smoke cigarettes till my voice starts to get hoarse and my eyelids droop. I will be back, there’s a party on Friday and a food/art event the following day.</p>

<p>It’s been an incredible first day and I trek back to the hostel, my wits about me as I am given a warning of safety as I leave. “I could live here” I think to myself, knowing all too well that such decisions should not be based on one day.</p>
